const doubled = nums.map(n => n \* 2);  
// [2, 4, 6]

🔹 filter() is a function which filters based on condition and returns new array

const nums = [1, 2, 3];  
const even = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);  
// [2]

🔹 forEach() is which function which Just loops and Returns nothing

nums.forEach(n => console.log(n));
